### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a special language used to make websites do things. Imagine a book where the pictures move, change, and even play sounds when you touch them. JavaScript is what makes the pictures move and the sounds play on websites. It makes websites more interesting and fun to use.

### Is JS a functional programming language?

JavaScript is a language that can do many different things, just like how you can use a pencil for drawing, writing, or even coloring. One of the things JavaScript can do is called "functional programming". Imagine you have a box of LEGO bricks. Each brick can do something special, like adding numbers together, or doubling a number. In JavaScript, these "special bricks" are like functions.
Functional programming in JavaScript means you can use these special bricks (functions) to build really cool things, like a calculator or a game. You can combine these functions in different ways to get new results. For example, you can add two numbers together, and then double the result using other functions.
So, JavaScript isn't just a functional programming language, but it can do functional programming really well because it has these special functions you can use in many different ways.

### The default behavior of JS

JavaScript (JS) is synchronous by default. This means that it executes code line by line in the order it appears. Each statement or function call blocks the execution until it completes. For example, if a function takes a long time to execute, it will block the next line of code from running until it finishes 


### What is ES6 in JavaScript?

ES6, or ECMAScript 6, is like a new set of rules for JavaScript that make it easier and better. Think of it like getting new and improved LEGO blocks that can do more things and are easier to build with. ES6 was released in 2015 and brought many helpful changes to JavaScript.

### Difference Between Old and New/Modern JavaScript

**Old JavaScript (Before ES6)**:
- **Var:** Imagine you have a toy box that anyone can open and take toys from at any time, which can sometimes create a mess.
- **Functions:** Think of long instructions you have to follow to make a sandwich. They are necessary but can be a bit long and complicated.

**Modern JavaScript (ES6 and Beyond)**:
- **Let and Const:** Now you have two types of toy boxes. One box (let) can be opened and toys can be changed, but only in the room you placed it. The other box (const) is like a display case for special toys that can't be changed.
- **Arrow Functions:** Imagine instead of a long list of sandwich instructions, you now have a quick and easy recipe that fits on a small card.

### Real-Life Example

Think of planning a birthday party:
- **Old JavaScript:** You have a big, messy list with all your plans scattered around the house. 
- **New JavaScript (ES6):** You have a neat, organized notebook where everything is in one place and easy to understand. This makes planning the party faster and more fun.

### Which JavaScript is Used Nowadays?

Nowadays, developers use the latest versions of JavaScript, which include all the features from ES6 and beyond. These modern versions help them create websites that are faster, more powerful, and easier to maintain.

### What are Variables and Constants in JS?

1. **Variables**:
   - **Definition**: Variables are like boxes where you can store data. In JavaScript, variables can hold different types of data, like numbers, text, or objects.
   - **Example**: If you have a box labeled "favorite toy," you can put your favorite toy in it. Similarly, a variable can store your favorite toy's name.

2. **Constants**:
   - **Definition**: Constants are like variables, but once you put something in the box, you can't change it. It's fixed.
   - **Example**: If you write "birth year" on a box and put your birth year in it, that year won't change. It's always the same.

### Variables Naming Conventions

1. **Unique Names**: Each variable should have a unique name.
2. **Meaningful Names**: Use names that describe what the variable holds.
   - **Example**: Use `age` for storing someone's age, not `x`.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: JavaScript is case-sensitive. `age` and `Age` are different.
4. **Rules**: Names can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. They must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.

### Difference Between `var`, `let`, and `const`

1. **`var`**:
   - Used to declare variables.
   - Can be updated and re-declared within its scope.
   - Function-scoped.

2. **`let`**:
   - Used to declare variables.
   - Can be updated but not re-declared within its scope.
   - Block-scoped.

3. **`const`**:
   - Used to declare constants.
   - Cannot be updated or re-declared.
   - Block-scoped.

### Syntax Breakdown for Creating Variables/Constants

For the example `let name = "Ali";`:

1. **`let`**:
   - **Definition**: `let` is a keyword used to declare a variable that is block-scoped.
   - **Analogy**: Think of `let` as deciding to use a box that you can only use in a certain room (block).

2. **`name`**:
   - **Definition**: `name` is the identifier or label of the variable.
   - **Analogy**: `name` is the label you put on the box to remember what's inside.

3. **`"Ali"`**:
   - **Definition**: `"Ali"` is the value assigned to the variable. It is a string, which means it is text.
   - **Analogy**: `"Ali"` is the toy or object you put inside the box.

### Simple Example

let name = "Ali";

- **`let`**: Declares a new variable.
- **`name`**: The name of the variable.
- **`"Ali"`**: The value assigned to the variable, which is a string.

#### Real-life Example

Imagine you have a box for your favorite fruit:


let favoriteFruit = "Mango";

- **`let`**: Declares the variable.
- **`favoriteFruit`**: The name of the variable.
- **`"Mango"`**: The value stored in the variable.

This means you have a box labeled "favorite fruit" and inside that box is a mango.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

### Function Scope

**Definition**: In JavaScript, function scope means that variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function. They are hidden from the rest of the code.

**Daily Life Example**:
- **Story**: Imagine you have a toy box in your room. The toys inside that box can only be played with when you are in your room. If you go to the living room, you can't access those toys unless you bring them with you.
- **Explanation**: The toy box represents a function, and the toys inside are the variables. Just like you can only play with the toys in your room, variables declared inside a function can only be used inside that function.

**Code Example**:


function playRoom() {
  let toy = "Car"; // toy is only accessible inside playRoom
  console.log(toy); // This works
}

console.log(toy); // This will cause an error because toy is not accessible here


### Block Scope

**Definition**: Block scope means that variables declared inside a pair of curly braces `{}` can only be accessed within those braces.

**Example**:
- **Story**: Imagine you build a small fort with pillows in the living room. The toys you put inside the fort can only be played with while you're inside the fort. Once you leave the fort, you can't reach those toys anymore.
- **Explanation**: The fort represents a block, and the toys inside are the variables. Just like you can only play with the toys inside the fort while you're in it, variables declared inside a block can only be used within that block.

**Code Example**:

if (true) {
  let fortToy = "Action Figure"; // fortToy is only accessible inside this block
  console.log(fortToy); // This works
}

console.log(fortToy); // This will cause an error because fortToy is not accessible here

### Simple Summary

1. **Function Scope**: Variables are like toys in a toy box (function). You can only play with them when you're in the room (inside the function).
2. **Block Scope**: Variables are like toys in a pillow fort (block). You can only play with them while you're inside the fort (inside the block).

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Hoisting in JavaScript

**Definition**: Hoisting is a special behavior in JavaScript where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope (either the entire script or a function) before the code is executed. This means you can use a variable or function before it’s actually declared in the code.

### Example

Imagine you have a magical notebook. Every morning, before you start your day, this notebook automatically moves your important tasks and notes to the first page, no matter where you wrote them the night before. So, when you open the notebook, you see all your important notes at the top.

**Explanation**: The magical notebook is like JavaScript's hoisting. The notes represent variables and functions. Even if you wrote them in the middle or at the end of the notebook, they appear at the top when you open it.

### Code Example

#### Variables

console.log(toy); // This will output: undefined
var toy = "Teddy Bear";
console.log(toy); // This will output: Teddy Bear

- **Explanation**: Even though `toy` is declared after the first `console.log`, JavaScript hoists the declaration to the top. However, the value assignment (`"Teddy Bear"`) remains in place, so the first `console.log` outputs `undefined`.

#### Functions

play(); // This will work and output: Playing!
function play() {
  console.log("Playing!");
}

- **Explanation**: The function `play` is hoisted entirely, so you can call it even before the actual function definition in the code.

### Simple Summary

1. **Hoisting**: Like a magical notebook that moves all important notes to the first page.
2. **Variables**: Declared but not assigned values are hoisted (appear at the top as `undefined`).
3. **Functions**: Entire function declarations are hoisted, so you can call them before they are defined.

### Primitives & Non-Primitives / Reference Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript has two main types of data: **primitive** and **non-primitive** (also known as **reference** types). Here's an easy way to understand them:

### Primitives

**Primitive data types** are like simple, single pieces of information. Imagine them as basic Lego blocks. Each block is a single, solid color and cannot be changed once made.

1. **String**:
   - **Example**: Like a name tag that says "Alice".
   - **Explanation**: A piece of text.

   let name = "Alice";


2. **Number**:
   - **Example**: Think of your age, like 7.
   - **Explanation**: Any number, whole or decimal.

   let age = 7;
   let pi = 3.14;


3. **Boolean**:
   - **Example**: Like a light switch, which can be on (true) or off (false).
   - **Explanation**: True or false values.

   let isSunny = true;
   let isNight = false;


4. **Undefined**:
   - **Example**: An empty lunchbox with nothing inside.
   - **Explanation**: A variable that hasn't been given a value.

   let myLunch;


5. **Null**:
   - **Example**: A toy box that is deliberately left empty.
   - **Explanation**: A variable with no value.

   let emptyBox = null;


6. **Symbol**:
   - **Example**: A unique badge number that only you have.
   - **Explanation**: Unique identifiers.

   let uniqueID = Symbol("id");


### Non-Primitives / Reference Types

**Non-primitive data types** are like complex Lego structures made of many blocks. They can hold multiple values and can be changed after creation.

1. **Object**:
   - **Example**: Like a toy chest filled with various toys.
   - **Explanation**: Stores multiple pieces of information.

   let toyChest = {
     toy: "car",
     color: "red",
     isNew: true
   };
   ```

2. **Array**:
   - **Example**: Think of a row of cubbies, each holding a different toy.
   - **Explanation**: A list of items.

   let toys = ["car", "doll", "ball"];


3. **Function**:
   - **Example**: A recipe card that tells you how to make a sandwich.
   - **Explanation**: A set of instructions or a reusable piece of code.

   function makeSandwich() {
     return "Sandwich made!";
   }


### Summary

- **Primitives** are simple, like single Lego blocks (strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, null, symbols).
- **Non-Primitives** are complex, like Lego structures made of many blocks (objects, arrays, functions).

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Is JavaScript Statically or Dynamically Typed?

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed** language.

#### Explanation with a Simple Example

Imagine you have a toy box, and you can put any toy you like inside without labeling the box. One day you put a teddy bear inside, and the next day you replace it with a toy car. You don’t have to tell anyone what’s inside the box ahead of time; you just put in the toy and play with it.

In JavaScript, you can do something similar with variables:


let myToyBox; // No need to specify what type of toy
myToyBox = "Teddy Bear"; // Put a string (text) inside
myToyBox = 5; // Now put a number inside


This is what we mean by **dynamically typed**: the type of the variable (what kind of toy is in the box) can change at any time. The computer figures out what type it is when the program runs.

#### Statically Typed (for Comparison)

Now, if JavaScript were **statically typed**, it would be like having a toy box with a label that says "Only Teddy Bears". Once you label it, you can only put teddy bears inside, and you can’t change it to a toy car later.

In a statically typed language like Java, you would do something like this:


String myToyBox = "Teddy Bear"; // Box labeled "Only Teddy Bears"
myToyBox = 5; // This would cause an error because only teddy bears (strings) are allowed


### Summary

- **JavaScript**: You can put any toy (data type) in the box (variable) without labeling it. This is dynamic typing.
- **Statically Typed Languages**: You must label the box, and you can only put that type of toy inside. This is static typing.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


In JavaScript, you can find the type of a variable using the `typeof` operator. This operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand's value. Here's how you can use it with some simple examples:

### Example


let age = 25;
console.log(typeof age); // "number"

let name = "Alice";
console.log(typeof name); // "string"

let isStudent = true;
console.log(typeof isStudent); // "boolean"

let car;
console.log(typeof car); // "undefined"

let person = null;
console.log(typeof person); // "object" (this is a known quirk in JavaScript)

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(typeof fruits); // "object"

let greet = function() { return "Hello"; };
console.log(typeof greet); // "function"


### Explanation

- `typeof age`: Returns `"number"` because `age` is a number.
- `typeof name`: Returns `"string"` because `name` is a string.
- `typeof isStudent`: Returns `"boolean"` because `isStudent` is a boolean.
- `typeof car`: Returns `"undefined"` because `car` is not assigned a value.
- `typeof person`: Returns `"object"` because `null` is considered an object in JavaScript (a known quirk).
- `typeof fruits`: Returns `"object"` because arrays are objects in JavaScript.
- `typeof greet`: Returns `"function"` because `greet` is a function.

### Note

The `typeof` operator is a quick and simple way to check the type of a variable. However, for arrays and other objects, you might need more specific methods, like `Array.isArray(variable)` to check if a variable is an array.

### More Specific Checks

To check if a variable is an array:


let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(Array.isArray(fruits)); // true


To check if a variable is an instance of a specific class or constructor:


class Car {}
let myCar = new Car();
console.log(myCar instanceof Car); // true


________________________________________________________________________________________________


String concatenation in JavaScript means joining two or more strings together to make one big string. Imagine you have two pieces of string, and you tie them together to make a longer string. It's like doing a craft project where you glue pieces of paper together to make a big picture.

Here are a couple of ways to concatenate strings in JavaScript, explained with fun examples:

1. **Using the + Operator**:
   - **Example**: Imagine you have a toy block with the letter "A" on it and another toy block with the letter "B" on it. If you put them side by side, you get "AB".
   - **Code**: `"Hello, " + "World!"` will give you `"Hello, World!"`.

2. **Using the += Operator**:
   - **Example**: Think of building a train. You have an engine, and you keep adding more carriages to it. Each time you add a carriage, the train gets longer.
   - **Code**: 

     let greeting = "Hello, ";
     greeting += "World!";
     // Now, greeting is "Hello, World!"


3. **Using the concat() Method**:
   - **Example**: Imagine you have two puzzles pieces, and when you put them together, they make a part of the picture.
   - **Code**: 

     let part1 = "Hello, ";
     let part2 = "World!";
     let fullGreeting = part1.concat(part2);
     // fullGreeting is "Hello, World!"


String concatenation is a fun and easy way to make your words and sentences longer by sticking them together!

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


## 🗒️ Answer

**String interpolation** or **template literals** in JavaScript are like magic tools that let you put words and variables together in a string easily. Think of them as special stickers that help you make sentences using different words and numbers.

Here’s how they work:

1. **Template Literals**:
   - Template literals are created using backticks (\` \`), not regular quotes.
   - They allow you to insert variables and expressions directly into the string using `${}`.

2. **String Interpolation**:
   - Interpolation is the process of inserting variables into a string.

### Simple Example
Imagine you are writing a story with toy characters:

1. **Without Template Literals**:
   - You might say: "Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old."
   - This is like cutting out pieces of paper and gluing them together.

2. **With Template Literals**:
   - You can say: \`Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.\`
   - This is like having a magic sticker that instantly combines everything.

### Fun Daily Life Example
- **Scenario**: Imagine you have a toy robot named Robo and you want to say what it’s doing.
- **Variables**:
  - `name = "Robo"`
  - `action = "dancing"`
  - `time = "morning"`

- **Without Template Literals**:

  let message = "Hello! " + name + " is " + action + " in the " + time + ".";
  console.log(message);
  // Output: Hello! Robo is dancing in the morning.


- **With Template Literals**:

  let message = `Hello! ${name} is ${action} in the ${time}.`;
  console.log(message);
  // Output: Hello! Robo is dancing in the morning.


Using template literals makes it much easier and cleaner to create sentences with dynamic content!
